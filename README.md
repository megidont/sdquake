# sdquake

COVID-19 is keeping me at home and I'm super stressed out about a lot of stuff right now and getting back into quake modding and this idea came to me when I couldn't sleep. It's poorly executed and definitely could use more work, but I'm not the one to do it.

Make sure to maintain adequate social distancing from all monsters.
